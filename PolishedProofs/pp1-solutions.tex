\section*{Directions}
    Create a blank template and complete the assignment in \LaTeX~  on Overleaf, 
    download the pdf and upload on Gradescope. There are two parts to the assignment: Proof and Reflection.

\section*{Proof Options}
    Please choose \textbf{one} of the following exercises. Begin with ``Claim:" and write the statement you intend to prove. 
    Then write ``Proof:" and the proof. You can choose your own end-of-proof marker for flair.
    \begin{enumerate}
	\item Prove $14 \mid a$ if and only if $7 \mid a$ and $2\mid a$.
        \begin{proof}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item[($\Rightarrow$)] First assume $14 \mid a$. Then there exists an integer $c$ such that $a=14c$. Observe that 
                \begin{align*}
                    a = 14c = 7(2c) = 2(7c).
                \end{align*}
                Since $2c, 7c \in \mathbb{Z}$, $7\mid a$ and $2\mid a$.
                \item[($\Leftarrow$)] Next assume $7\mid a$ and $2\mid a$. Then there exist integers $d,e$ such that $a=7d$ and $a=2e$. Since $7d=2e$, $2\mid (7d)$ implies that $7d$ is even. Since $7$ is odd, $d$ is even. Then there exists an integer $f$ such that $d=2f$. Observe 
                \begin{align*}
                    a = 7d = 7(2f) = 14f.
                \end{align*}
                Therefore, $14\mid a$.
            \end{enumerate}
            Therefore, $14 \mid a$ if and only if $7 \mid a$ and $2\mid a$.
        \end{proof}
	\item Prove $x$ is even if and only if $3x+5$ is odd.
        \begin{proof}
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item[($\Rightarrow$)] First we assume that $x$ is even. Then there exists an integer $a$ such that $x=2a$. Observe
                \begin{align*}
                    3x+5 = 3(2a)+5 = 2(3k+2)+1, 
                \end{align*}
                where $3k+2$ is an integer. Therefore $3x+5)$ is odd.
                \item[($\Leftarrow$)] Next we assume that $3x+5$ is odd. Then there exists an integer $b$ such that $3x+5 = 2b+1$. Observe 
                \begin{align*}
                    3x = 2b+1 - 5 = 2b-4 = 2(b-2), 
                \end{align*}
                where $b-2$ is an integer. Then $3x$ is even. Since $3$ is odd, $x$ must be even.
            \end{enumerate}
            Therefore, $x$ is even if and only if $3x+5$ is odd.
        \end{proof}
    \end{enumerate}

\section*{Reflection Prompt}
    Please provide at least a paragraph explaining your process to completing the proof you have chosen above. You may use the following prompts to guide your response and any additional information needed to support your reflection. Responses consisting of one sentence or less for each of the following prompts will not be acceptable.
    \begin{itemize}
        \item What was your strategy/procedure to the proof?
        \item Were you following a template or problem during the proof?
        \item What did you find challenging at first?
        \item When did you realize you had figured it out?
        \item How much time did you spend on the problem, before and after discovering the answer?
    \end{itemize}

\section*{Grading Rubric}
    This assignment will be graded on a scale of 1-15 points.
    \begin{itemize}
    \item The proof will be graded out of 12 points via the RVF rubric (9 points) and the remaining 3 points will be given for the proper use of \LaTeX.
    \item The reflection will be graded out of 3 points. It must be thoughtful and concise, addressing all the prompts provided and any additional information needed to support the reflection.
    \end{itemize}
